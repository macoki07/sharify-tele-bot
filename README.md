#### Video Demo:  <[URL HERE]()>

### Description:
Hello there! My name is Matthew, I am from Singapore and I have created Sharify!
Sharify is a Telegram Bot that allows you and your friends to easily share music with one another.
Used library:
* python-dotenv
* pytest
* python-telegram-bot
* requests
* 
Ever got fustrated when you're talking to friends about a particular song/artist/album?
Well, with Sharify you can be assured that your friends know what you're talking about

### How the bot works:

To get the bot to work, you must first search for @OfficialSharifyBot on Telegram.
Next, type /start to start the bot, thereafter type /help to see how the bot works.
Type -artist <ArtistName> to get a specific artist link on Spotify!
Type -song <SongName> to get a specific song link on Spotify!
Type -album <AlbumName> to get a specific album link on Spotify!

### Afterthoughts on CS50p:
Coming from a guy who learned C/C++, Python was easy to get a hang of. From working with Strings and then using Regular Expressions as a way to validate input to even programming using OOP. C/C++ has taught me to appreciate higher level languages so much, more than I could imagine! Honestly, learning Python has revitalized my love for programming. While CS50p has come to an end, Sharify has got alot improvements to make namely features such as:
* Deploying the bot using Flask so that the bot will be on 24/7
* Add surport for Youtube sharing

With that, I would like to thank David J. Malan and team for delivering such a beautiful course.

This was CS50p.
